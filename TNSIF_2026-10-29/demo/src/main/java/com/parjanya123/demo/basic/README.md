Spring bean basics
This package contains small, runnable examples for learning Spring Core beans.

Run any class with its main method from the IDE:

BeanMethodExample - creates a bean with @Bean inside a @Configuration class.
ComponentBeanExample - registers a class annotated with @Component.
ConstructorInjectionExample - injects MessageRepository into MessageService through its constructor.
BeanScopeExample - compares Spring's default singleton scope with prototype scope.
The examples use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, so no web server is required. Each context is closed automatically with try-with-resources.
